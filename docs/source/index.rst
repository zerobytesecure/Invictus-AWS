Invictus-AWS documentation!
===================================

Invictus-AWS is a python script that will help automatically enumerate and acquire relevant data from an AWS environment. The tool doesn't require any installation it can be run as a standalone script with minimal configuration required. The goal for Invictus-AWS is to allow incident responders or other security personnel to quickly get an insight into an AWS environment to answer the following questions:

* What services are running in an AWS environment.
* For each of the services what are the configuration details.
* What logging is available for each of the services that might be relevant in an incident response scenario.
* Is there any threat that I can find easily with the CloudTrail logs.
